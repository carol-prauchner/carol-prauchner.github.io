									<h1>Curiosities</h1>
									<p>Welcome to the page where I describe some of my hobbies that I think are interesting to share. Here, you’ll find a bit of myself apart from the professional side that fills most of this site's pages!</p>

								<h2>Languages!</h2>
								<p>One of the things that really interests me is learning new languages. To give you an idea of how much, I’ve had classes at some point in my life of English, Spanish, Dutch, German, French, Russian, and Mandarin. I also tried to learn a bit of Korean by myself (and I can proudly say that I can read a bit of Hangul – the Korean alphabet already). However, I don’t speak most of them, I wish I could. And at some point, I’ll probably go back to some of those or maybe try new ones, who knows. Talking a bit about how I learned each:<br />
								<li>I’ve been learning English since my school years as it is taught in every Brazilian school. I also took an English course to improve my skills during my undergraduate years because I knew it would be important for my career and I wanted to apply for an internship program.</li>
								<li>Spanish, I learned while preparing for the university entrance exams. I had to choose one foreign language and this one was the best one to get more points with each right question on the exam. So, I ended up having two years of Spanish lessons.</li>
								<li>I'm a double degree PhD candidate at a Dutch university and I lived there for a year as part of my work. So, I took an intensive Dutch course to learn the basics and get to know a bit more of their culture. I can say that I enjoyed this language a lot! However, the sound of "g" is impossible for me!!! I'm still studying this language in my spare time nowadays.</li>
								<li>German, I confess that I don’t remember much! My grandparents can speak a bit of German, so it was a language that always caught my attention since I was a kid. So, as a teen, I took a few months of private lessons. It was a bit hard at first, but it was really nice to see how my grandparents were happy to hear me trying to say things in German to them.</li>
								<li>About French, remember what I said earlier about wanting to apply for an internship? I did it and got accepted to study for a year in Scotland, as part of my undergraduate course. You may wonder what Scotland has to do with learning French. Well, I was pretty advanced in my course and selected all courses related to my Bachelor's that I could take and still had time to fill on my schedule. So, I decided to enroll in French courses! I ended up doing two semesters of French at the University of Aberdeen. It was a challenge at first, to learn a new language through a second one, but it was worth it! I would say that I’m a beginner in French, but I can manage to read scientific papers related to my area of expertise pretty well and I would definitely not starve in a French-speaking country!</li>
								<li>Russian is the language that I remember the least! I enrolled for one semester out of curiosity. Because I didn’t have many places where I could practice it and couldn’t enroll for the classes the following semester because it collided with some of my master’s courses, I ended up forgetting most of it. This was the first language that didn’t use the Roman alphabet, it uses the Cyrillic one, which was a nice challenge!</li>
								<li>Last, but not least, Mandarin! I studied it for a year during the COVID-19 pandemic, so I had online classes. In Brazil, people stayed mostly at home for almost two whole years during the pandemic, so this course was really helpful as something to get distracted while being at home. This language was a pretty hard challenge to learn! Not only it doesn’t use an alphabet, it uses ideograms, but also it has four different tones! Which is something I didn’t really know existed, but now I know that some languages can have more than ten tones! I enjoyed learning this language and I hope I can resume this course at some point. I know some pretty basic sentences, which could maybe help me to survive in China. Writing this made me think that I need to review my notes and books so I can remove the “maybe” from the previous sentence. </li></p>
								<h2>Musical taste: eclectic!</h2>
								<p>Listening to music is present every day in my life! I like to listen to music while on the bus, in the shower, while studying/working, or when I’m cleaning my place. As to my musical taste, I guess it was pretty influenced by my hobby of learning new languages. If you take a look at my playlists on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/11149600328?si=19f90f55a18348fb" class="text">Spotify</a>, you’ll understand what I mean. I created or follow playlists for every genre that I like, such as Brazilian ROCK or MPB (which stands for Brazilian Popular Music in Portuguese), pop, k-pop, c-pop (these last two are Korean and Chinese pop), indie, Sertanejo, Pagode/Samba (these last two are Brazilian genres), among others. But I also have playlists of songs in specific languages, such as French, Dutch, Chinese, Spanish… So, you see, one hobby affects the other. As I mentioned before, music helps me in doing my daily activities or just to pass the time. However, beyond that, they are also a very nice and interesting way of practicing new languages, since you can learn new vocabulary and practice some listening. I also practice a bit of speaking trying to sing along some songs. And no, I don’t sing at all! So, I’m really sorry to my family and my actual housemate for all the suffering and ear harm caused!</p>
								<h2>Dungeons & Dragons!</h2>
								<p>I would like to write “Role Playing Games” as a title, however, D&D is the only one that I played. I started playing it quite late compared to most people that enjoy RPG, I was in my late twenties. I started playing thanks to an intern I was supervising at the ZOOBOT who, after talking over coffee one day, invited me to try it out when I said I was really curious about it. Since then, I’ve been playing pretty often with different groups of friends! It’s really interesting how I found that so many people I knew for quite some time play RPGs and I didn’t know before. <br />
								I don’t think I can explain everything about RPG or D&D here. But, in general, there is a person who controls the story and each of the other players interprets a specific character that they create. The world of D&D is a fantasy world similar to a medieval era where creatures of different races and species live. I’ve played before as a druid elf and a druid aasimar. Nowadays, I’ve been playing with two groups, and on both, I interpret rogue tieflings. If you have no idea of what I’m talking about, you can search online for the D&D players handbook where you can find the description of races and classes, as well as other rules and topics about it!<br />
							I explained a slightly bit of it, so now I can explain better why I like it. I’ve always liked to read fantasy books because it’s a way of entering new worlds. Play D&D works the same way for me. Every session, I get to experience the point of view of different characters in completely different worlds. I can exercise my imagination and hang out with friends, which helps a lot to deal with everyday life stress. In the character-building process, I get to think and try to comprehend different points of view while building each character’s personality and background story. I believe that this process also helps in become more understanding of people around me, so I can say that RPG can help someone improve certain soft skills that are important in any work area.	</p>
							<h2>Puzzles and board games!</h2>
							<p>Some friends find it quite amusing that I’m a bit addicted to playing puzzle games, especially jigsaw puzzles, on my phone. I play jigsaw games almost every day before going to bed. I love it! And I’ve liked jigsaw puzzles since I was a kid. Trying to recognize patterns to fit each piece together is something that really gets me focused. Maybe that is also why I’m building a scientific career in science. In my work as a PhD in science and ecology, I get to try to find and understand patterns, so I can explain certain aspects of the world we live in. Apart from jigsaw, there are several other games, such as board games, that I enjoy. Those are usually games that involve strategies, like the Game of Thrones board game (I love the game, but I never watched the series). </p>
